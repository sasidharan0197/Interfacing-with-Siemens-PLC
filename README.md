# Interfacing-with-Siemens-PLC
Here is the C# based code in order to control the machine from the PC to machine controller (PLC), Here is the repository only for communication with Siemens PLC's
1. High pressure (say >300 bar) flushing machine data acquisition from the machine PLC (Siemens S7-315 CPU) and control the same by getting the component status from oracle Database.
2. Ensuring any leak in the manufactured component and control the leak test machine by interfacing the machine PLC (Siemens PLC - S71200) using Profinet communicaion and data store into the MSSQL Database
